STAT project 5

Introduction
This project focuses on visualizing the well-known Iris dataset, which contains data on three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset provides measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for each flower sample.

Project Structure
-Data Exploration and Visualization: Initial exploration of the full dataset, followed by the creation of a dashboard containing four visualizations:
  - Scatter Plot of Sepal Width vs. Sepal Length
  - Bar Chart showing the distribution of each species
  - Pie Chart showing the distribution of each species as a percentage
  - 3D Scatter Plot visualizing sepal length, sepal width, and petal length

-Subset Analysis: Analysis is redone using a subset of the data, with modified visualization colors.

-Data Visualization Principles Demonstrated: This section illustrates various visualization principles using specific code examples:
  - Data Interpretation
  - Data Categorization
  - Data Representation
  - Emphasis and Hierarchy
  - User Engagement
  - Color Scales
  - Contrast
  - Color Symbolism
  - Consistency

-Dataset Description
sepal_length: Length of the iris flower's sepal (in centimeters)
sepal_width: Width of the iris flower's sepal (in centimeters)
petal_length: Length of the iris flower's petal (in centimeters)
petal_width: Width of the iris flower's petal (in centimeters)
species: Species of the iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

-Getting Started
Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib, plotly) installed.
Download the iris.csv dataset and store it in the project directory.
Run the provided Python scripts to generate visualizations.
